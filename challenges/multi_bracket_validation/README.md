# Multi Bracket Validation

**Author** : Jay Adams
**Version**: 0.1.0

## Overview
fort Python: create a function called multi_bracket_validation(input)
Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

Round Brackets : ()
Square Brackets : []
Curly Brackets : {}
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.



## Getting Started
Do all your work in a public repository called data-structures-and-algorithms, with a well-formated, detailed top level README.md matching the example provided by your instructor
Create a branch in your repository called multi-bracket-validation
On your branch, createâ€¦
C#: your methods outside of Main() in your Program.cs file
JavaScript: a file called multi-bracket-validation.js
Python: a file called multi_bracket_validation.py
