# K-Tree print_level_order
**Author** : Jay Adams
**Version**: 0.2.0

## Overview



## Spec
---------------
Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a k-ary tree. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a string that contains a listing of all values in the tree, with new lines in-between each level of the tree.
Structure and Testing
Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
